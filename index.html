<h6> a bit about me...</h6>

<p> I am a student from the UK who is highly academic over a wide range 
    of subjects such as mathematics and sciences to history and foreign 
    languages. I also play violin to a grade 5 standard, and have engaged in 
    a wide variety of extra-curricular activities - cricket, scouts, DofE, 
    orchestra, volunteering. I'm generally quite good at intergrating into
    a group, and am able to understand and work with most personality types.
